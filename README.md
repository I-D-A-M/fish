## *I.D.I-M Fish Shell scripts*
This repo is intended for tracking my shell scripts and setup for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/). As such, a lot of these scripts will probably need modifying / wont be any use at all for someone else!

That said, config.fish is a good place to start if you haven't used fish before (equivalent to your .bashrc file) and fish_prompt.fish is a modified version of [this](https://geraldkaszuba.com/tweaking-fish-shell/) prompt by Gerald Kaszuba.
